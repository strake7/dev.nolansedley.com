The use of a SPA application for website development has reigned supreme for
several years now and before that MVC web applications were all the rage. No
doubt, we learned a lot from these employing these solutions but they can
sometimes have considerable and needless overhead when developing something
simple.

Say, for example, we are building a blog web page. Do we really need a complex
javascript framework with an internal routing system operating in the client's
browser? A typical blog is just a publication of _static_ content; usually just
text and some pictures. For site such as this we should be able to just serve
html content with little to no client-side javascript. You might conclude that
this is a good fit for server-rendered web pages but is it necessary to have a
dedicated server-side framework to construct a web page on every request?
Remember the cost of having a server receive the request, run your message
handler, compile a web page and serve that content. A far more optimal solution
would be to pre-render the html page earlier, at the time of the build, rather
than compiling it repeatedly at run-time.

## Enter Jamstack

Of course, we could simply write some static html files and call it good but
there is sure to be a large amount of duplication and we will certainly lose out
on tooling with such an approach. Our inner-developer might cringe at such a
prospect. Fortunately the tooling for building pre-rendered static sites has
progressed. Enter **Jamstack**, an architecture designed to solve this problem
using the modern tools and workflows web developers have come to love. With a
pre-rendered site build using Jamstack, files can be served directly from a CDN
enabling the site to **easily scale and cutting back on cost, complexity and
risk**.

Let's decompose this stack further. Here are the primary attributes of a
Jamstack site:

1. The site is pre-rendered, meaning web pages are generated at the time of
   build.
1. The site is deployed to a CDN where requests for pages simply
   return the pre-rendered HTML page.
1. In the browser, the site uses **Javascript** as the runtime. Given the site
   is pre-rendered this may be a minimal amount of client-side operations.
1. Server side operations are abstracted into reusable APIs and accessed over
   via JavaScript.
1. Source files are written in some **Markup** language, such as Markdown, that
   can be compiled to HTML using a static site generator.

## Getting Started

The best way to understand the stack is to work with it. There are several
Jamstack-oriented frameworks that are easy to get started with:

1. [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/): this blog is built using Gatsby. It is quite easy to get started with and has an excellent community surrounding it with a plethora of starter templates and plugins.
2. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): equally as great as Gatsby with a bit less boilerplate. I have preferred this framework for mixed static and server-rendered sites.
3. [Other generators](https://jamstack.org/generators/)

With Gatsby or Next.js you write React components from which the the static
pages are rendered on build. This site is built using the Gatsby blog starter template. Think of a kind of site that you would like to
create. Here are some ideas that I think are befitting a Jamstack:

1. Blog
1. Documentation
1. Company information
1. Announcements
1. Resume
1. Product listings

Jamstack is a modern architecture for building pre-rendered sites. So
when building your next website, do not feel obligated to build a SPA
application or dedicate a server for rendering runtime pages. Pre-rendered sites
are quite powerful and have a degree of simplicity that will enable you to
quickly produce results.
