# Static Webpages and JAM-stack
The use of a SPA application for website development has reigned supreme for several years now and before that MVC web applications were all the rage.
We learned a lot from these evolutions but these solutions can have considerable and sometimes needless overhead when wanting to develop something simple.

Say, for example, we are building a blog web site. Do need complex javascript framework operating in the client's browser? 
A typical blog is just a publication of *static* content; usually just text and some pictures. 
For this kind of site we should be able to just serve html content with little to no client-side javascript. 
OK, you might say this is a good fit for MVC server rendered web pages. You could do that but do you really need a server-side language to process the web request and construct a view?
Remember the cost of having a server receive the request, run your message handler, compile a web page and serve that content.
A far more optimal solution would be to pre-render the html page earlier, perhaps at build time, rather than compiling it repeatedly at runtime. 

Of course, we could simply write some static html files and call it good but there is sure to be a large amount of duplication employing such an approach.
Our collective inner-developer might cringe at such a prospect.
We may even be tempted to use the same GUI static site builder that we used in our high-school years.
Fortunately that will not be necessary. 
## Enter Jamstack
Fortunately the tooling for building static sites has progressed alongside other approaches.
Enter Jamstack.
You can simply go write some static html files and call it good.
Static webpages are the core

## Getting started
Suggested frameworks:
1. [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/): this blog is built using Gatsby. It is quite easy to get started with and has an excellent community surrounding it with a plethora of starter templates and plugins.
2. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): equally as great as Gatsby with a bit less boilerplate. I have preferred this framework for mixed static and server-rendered sites.
3. [Other generators](https://jamstack.org/generators/)

Think of a kind of site that you would like to create. 
Here are some ideas that I think are befitting a static website:
1. Blog
1. Documentation
1. Company information
1. Announcement
1. Resume
1. Marketplace

routing library to determine what I am sure we can all remember our first website; chances are it was likely static. for certain though these solutions can sometimes be overkill for certain problems.

All that has brought us what may seem like a full-circle; back to static applications. Building static websites using dreamweaver was some of my first introductions to the software world. The way to build these static sites has fortunately evolved to the point of many commonplace frameworks supporting a static site build output. I am 

 Albeit the way of building these static web sites has evolved but the core principles persist:
Static sites are:
1. Fast
2. Cheap
3. 


So when you are building you're next website do not feel the need to create a full SPA application or even develop server-side code. Leverage the organic mechanisms of a website and develop static pages using  Consider
