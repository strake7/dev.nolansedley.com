Long live VSCode and plain text!

Let's take a scenario

Postman has a lot of features that cannot be found in this extension alone but for a simple http client, I prefer simple text files and commands to a clunky GUI. I'm sure you could apply some scripting on top of these http files to emulate some "test-runner" features found in Postman


Features:
1. Free and open


Tips:
1. View request history
1. Copy as cURL
